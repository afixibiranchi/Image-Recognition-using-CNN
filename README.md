# Image-Recognition-using-CNN
This repository introduction to Convolutional Neural Network with dropout and l2 loss to detect 100 classes of images

```python
# learning rate for back propagate
learning_rate = 0.01

# dropout probability for lossing connection between nodes
dropout_probability = 1.0

# penalty system
penalty = 0.0005

# 20 images per feed
batch_size = 20

# total epoch
epoch = 1000
```

Right now the model kinda sucks, so I need to recheck
